## Notes
- Video input: In the `process_frame` function, `cv.VideoCapture(0)` sets the laptop webcam as the video input source. To use a USB camera, you might need to try indexes 2, 3, or 4.
- The camera is meant to be placed at an angle close to the ground with the line at the same field of view as the trapezoidal frame. Try placing a rectangular object in front of a blank background and orienting the edges to match the trapezoid, as shown below:
